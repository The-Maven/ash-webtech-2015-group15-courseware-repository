#WORKS PERFECTLY WITH GOOGLE CHROME OTHER BROWSERS SUCH AS FIREFOX MIGHT DISTORT THE CSS AND CENTER THE CONTENT

the repository is for professors only and professors must login

The Admin user has the username: hello   password: world   - only he can add a new faculty and professors, other users can't. For this project the admin is just this person

other users can edit only their courses without interfereing with others but can view the details of other users' courses

professors and courses can not be deleted because the university would like to keep a history of professors and courses

Enjoy
